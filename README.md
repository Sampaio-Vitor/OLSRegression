# Salary Analysis with OLS

This project focuses on performing salary analysis using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression technique. The goal is to explore the relationship between various factors such as education, job position, and location, and their impact on salary.

## Introduction

In this project, we employ the OLS regression model to analyze salary data. By using statistical techniques, we aim to uncover the factors that significantly influence salary. This analysis can provide valuable insights into the relationships between education, job position, location, and income.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about individuals' salaries, along with corresponding attributes such as education level, job position, and location. Before conducting the analysis, we preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, reindexing columns, and adding dummy variables.

## Installation

To run the code and reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Execute the notebook OLS_Final.ipynb to perform the OLS regression analysis.

## Usage

Modify the `OLS_Final.ipynb` script according to your specific requirements. You can customize the variables, add or remove features, and fine-tune the analysis parameters to suit your needs.

## Results

After training the OLS regression model, we evaluate its performance and interpret the coefficients to understand the impact of each variable on salary. The results are presented in the form of statistical metrics and visualizations, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the salary analysis.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community to enhance this project. If you have any suggestions, bug fixes, or new features to propose, feel free to submit a pull request.
